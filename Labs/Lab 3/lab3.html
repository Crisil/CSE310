        <p>
            Throughout this lab, the process of building the circuit wasn't that difficult because I'm getting used to working with the equipment. My group did complete the circuit that we needed to build towards the end of the lab. We knew what to do during this lab when it came to building the circuit that was shown.<br>
            The only difficult part in this lab that I had a hard time in doing was understanding and compeleting a stimulus for example 4-2. Even though I had trouble doing so, at the end I was able to complete it. Doing these verilog programs are difficult to me because I've never coded anything like this in the past, but as I continue to do more I am able to be familiarized with the process.
