            D0 = Q0`
            D1 = Q0`Q1 + Q3`Q0Q1`
            D2 = Q2`Q0Q1 + Q2Q0` + Q2Q1`

        <h2> Lab Report & Questions </h2>
        <p>
            <b>Can one build a ripple counter from a '374? Why not?<br></b>
            You cannot build a ripple counter from a '374 beause there's no Q`<br><br>
            <b>Do your observations agree with what you expect (Figure 5-4(b) )? <br></b>
            Yes, our observations do agree with what I would expect from our latch. Our circuit follows what the table provides.<br><br>
            <b>Explain why the input S=0 R=0 should be forbidden.<br></b>
            The reason why the input S=0 and R=0 should be forbidden is because the output of the two gives 1 1, which are the same. The output should contradict each other in order for it to be considered a latch.

			When conducting this lab, it was pretty simple because Professor Qiao explained what were some of the procedures we needed to do in order to complete this experiment. This lab was actually kind of fun because we're getting so used to building these types of circuits, we can just finish things so much more faster than previous labs. I can tell that the more we build these circuits, the easier these labs can be.<br>
            We constructed the SR flip flop with our circuit and it worked perfectly. I also answered all the questions that were asked o and at the end of the lab, my group finished everything.
