            We did demonstrate our circuit to Professor Yu and he said it was correct when he was using the meter to measure the voltages.<br><br>
            <b> 3. </b>The reason why the circuit adds is because they're in series and they're logic gates. They're not in parallel so they would add directly across.

        <h2> Lab Report </h2>
            This lab was very challenging because I have never worked with Iverilog before as well with chips. Although it was difficult, I felt like my group obtained the right answer but did not have time to test it out. So at the end, we did complete most of the lab but are unsure of the outcome, whether we got it correct or not. Also, I felt like I learned many new things about circuits because it was my first time working with chips and circuits together. It was actually pretty fun to do when we figured it out. So at the end, I believe I completed maybe 90% of the lab.
