        <h2> 1. Resistors </h2>
        <p>
            <h4> Data Measurements: </h4>
            Resistor 1 alone: 500 &#937; <br>
            Resistor 2 alone: 15,000 &#937; <br>
            Resistors in series: 15,500 &#937; <br>
            Resistors in parallel: 480 &#937;
            <h4> Verify by Calculation: </h4>
            Resistors in series: 15,500 &#937; <br>
            Resistors in parallel : 483 &#937;
            <h4> Predict by Calculation: </h4>
            Current through resistor 1:10 milliamp <br>
            Current through resistor 2: .333 ma <br>
            Current through resistors in series: 3.23 ma<br>
            Current through resistors in parallel: 10.352 ma
            <h4> Data measurements using the multimeter: </h4>
            Current through resistor 1: .34 ma <br>
            Current through resistor 2: 9.72 ma <br>
            Current through resistors in series: .32 ma<br>
            Current through resistors in parallel: 10.03 ma
        </p>
        <h2> 2. Diode </h2>
        <p>
            <h4> Data Measurements: </h4>
            Diode one way: 4.5 M&#937; <br>
            Diode Reversed: 0 &#937;<br>
            Voltage across diode with one resistor: .5 V <br>
            Voltage across diode with two resistors in series: .17 V <br>
            A. Which end must be connected to ground? <br>
            The black end of the diode must be connected to ground.<br>
            B. What would happen if you use a resistor with a much larger resistance? <br>
            If we were to have a resistor with a larger reisttance, our current passing through the diode would be much smaller. The diode is used for light bulbs and if we were to have more resistance in our lightbulb, our light would be little to no light at all. <br>
            C. We did demonstrate our circuit to the instructor.

        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p>
            Even though this was the first time working with a circuit board it was challenging. By asking questions from the instructor I figured out how to build the circuit on the board and complete Lab 1. Creating the circuit was mostly the hard part in this lab because I haven't relly had any experience with a circuit board like that, but doing the math was easy. Overall, it was a good experience by interacting with new things in this lab. I finished 100%.
