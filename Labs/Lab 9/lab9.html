        <p>
            1) Make sure the counter starts counting from $000_2$, how?<br>
            Well basically we would just have make sure our clock starts at 0. Once we're done with 0, our clock should move on to the next number.<br><br>
            2) Make sure the counter does not count beyond $7=111_2$ because it would cause ACC to add content of the register file more than once. How do you accomplish this?<br>
            How we would make sure our counter does not count beyond 7 is by modifying our clock.

        <h2> Lab Report </h2>
            <p>
                As we were doing the last lab, we had to complete the previous lab in order to do this lab. We ended up completing the previous lab which were programming the pld, Building the Add/Sub, and building the rest of the circuits that were needed. <br>
                The only thing that was not on our side, again, was time. There was so much to do and we couldn't really ask for help because Professor. Qiao was helping out HC with their presentations and grading. We didn't finish this lab to the fullest because of the time. Even so, we were able to see an example from another group that helped us visualize what the experiment outcome was supposed to output. <br>
                So at the end, I believe that our group should be given an 19 out of 20 because of all the work that we put in. We were close to finishing the final circuit, and we worked really hard to try to finish it.
