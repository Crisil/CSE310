        <h2> Lab Report </h2>
            <p>
                This lab was beyond hard because my group and I have never worked with the Spartan3 board before, but it was cool to see and work with one. I find it cool how it looks like a mini motherboard, but the learning curve was steep. Even if a manual was provided for the Spartan 3 board, it would still take a large amount of time in order for us to finish because of the lack of previous exposure to the board. <br>
                Completeing the code that was unfinished was pretty easy but creating the code for the Spartan3 board was difficult, we spent most of the time doing this. As a result of not knowing how to do most of the lab, we only had a hour left to complete the rest of it, but Professor Yu allowed us to finish the rest on Tuesday of next week.<br>
                At the end of the day, I'm going to give myself a 19 on this lab because of how much effort was put into this lab. We tried our best and even though we didn't finish constructing the circuit, Professor Yu allowed us to finish it in the next lab session.
